= transit-occupancy-dashboard

if you do not have this environment then create it. To run just follow the instructions based on docker as described  below.

== Running app with Docker
---
docker build -t wegodash .
docker run --memory='4g' --rm -p 8080:8080 wegodash
---

Note we give 4 gigabyte to this.


= Development instructions

Check your environments.

[source,bash]
----
conda env list
----
Remove as needed.

[source,bash]
----
conda --yes remove --name transit_dashboard --all
----
Create and activate the new environment.

[source,bash]
----
conda create --name transit_dashboard python=3.8
conda activate transit_dashboard
----

Add the packages into the new environment.
It is tempting [to use pip](
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#using-pip-in-an-environment).
It may be that some packages are not available in the main conda repositories for your platform.
In that case you may need to add additional channels.

[source,bash]
----
# conda config --prepend channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority false

conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
----

== converting between basic python and notebooks

use ipynb-py-convert

[source,bash]
----
conda --yes install ipynb-py-convert
----

== Running app in development environment

[source,bash]
----
conda activate transit_dashboard
python app.py
----
